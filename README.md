# stash-rs

An (experimental) Rust library for interacting with the Atlassian Stash API.

## Documentation

Coming soon...

## Overview

Stash is a wrapper around the Atlassian Stash API, which provides typesafe builders and wrappers around the datatypes the API returns.

## Example Usage

## Supported APIs

API support is built into the library as I need it, so I may not personally implement every bit functionality that the Stash API supports.

The currently supported APIs are:

* Parts of [Stash core](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/stash/latest/stash-rest.html)

## License

Distributed under [Apache 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birryree/stash-rs/master/LICENSE), because information wants to be free.
